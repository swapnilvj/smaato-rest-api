# smaato-rest-api
Build a Java application - REST service which is able to process 10K requests per second. ● The service has one GET endpoint - /api/smaato/accept which is able to accept an integer id as a mandatory query parameter and an optional string HTTP endpoint query parameter. It should return String “ok” if there were no errors processing the request and “failed” in case of any errors. ● Every minute, the application should write the count of unique requests your application received in that minute to a log file - please use a standard logger . Uniqueness of request is based on the id parameter provided. ● When the endpoint is provided, the service should fire an HTTP GET request to the provided endpoint with count of unique requests in the current minute as a query parameter. Also log the HTTP status code of the response.
